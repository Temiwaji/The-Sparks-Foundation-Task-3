# The-Sparks-Foundation-Task-3
An Exploratory Data Analysis of a sample superstore dataset is available in this repository.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for better understanding your data and assisting in subsequent data preprocessing. It is the critical process of conducting preliminary data investigations to discover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process that employs a variety of techniques to better understand the dataset under consideration. Exploratory Data Analysis accomplishes two major tasks:

It aids in the cleanup of a dataset.
It improves your understanding of the variables and their relationships. EDA assists in gathering insights and making better sense of data, as well as removing irregularities and unnecessary values from data, aids in preparing dataset for analysis, enables a machine learning model to predict dataset more accurately, also aids in the selection of a better machine learning model. This project extracts, cleans and visualizes the dataset from a sample superstore.
The link to the dataset used in this task was obtained from https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

IDE used is Jupyter notebook.
